      <h3>Saving should not cost you money or heartaches</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No bank fees. Ever.</li>
        <li>No minimum to open.</li>
        <li>Flexibility to contribute as much as you want: $50, $25, $7&mdash;any amount!</li>
        <li>Life sometimes gets complicated. You can withdraw from the principal without penalty whenever you need it (for example, to cover medical bills).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="benefit-block">
      <h3>Available wherever you work, even if you are self-employed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your plan stays with you even when you change jobs.</li>
        <li>If you have more than one job, you can contribute from all your paychecks into a single myRA account.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="benefit-block">
      <h3>Easy to start and keep saving</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If your employer is making myRA available, they can setup automatic deposit out of your paycheck. So if you choose to save $50 per pay period, they will deposit $50 into your myRA instead of your bank account.</li>
        <li>If your employer is not making myRA available, or if you are self-employed, you can still set up an automatic deposit from your bank account into your myRA account.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="benefit-block">
      <h3>An safe investment with steady returns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Investment is backed by the U.S. Treasury</li>
        <li>Your investment never loses value</li>
        <li>Once you save $15,000 (or save for 30 years), you can then roll your myRA over into a private Roth IRA.</li>

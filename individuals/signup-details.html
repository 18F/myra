<h1>Signup Details</h1>
<p class="lead-text">Currently, you can only fund your <span class="myra">myRA</span> account by direct deposit through an employer, especially through an employer that participates in the <span class="myra">myRA</span> program.  However, you can fund your <span class="myra">myRA</span> account through any employer as long as they offer direct deposit and they are able to set up a portion to be directed to your <span class="myra">myRA</span> account.  In the near future, the U.S. Treasury will be making other methods available for you to contribute to your <span class="myra">myRA</span> account.</p>

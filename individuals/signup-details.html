    <p>It is possible that you may not qualify to contribute to a <span class="myra">myRA</span> at this time.</p>
    <p><span class="myra">myRA</span> is a Roth IRA, and like other IRAs, requires that you (or your spouse, if married filing jointly) have taxable compensation to be eligible to contribute. Under the IRS compensation rules, your unemployment status may not qualify you to contribute to <span class="myra">myRA</span>. For specific information on your eligibility to contribute to an IRA, you may need to speak to a financial advisor.</p>

  <h1>Key Roth IRA Features</h1>

  <p>A Roth IRA is an individual retirement arrangement described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code. Some key Roth IRA features include:</p> 

  <ul> 

    <li><strong>Tax attributes.</strong> Amounts ca n be withdrawn from a Roth IRA at any time, but special tax rules apply. Contributions to a Roth IRA are after-tax, so they will not be taxed again when they are distributed (and these non-taxable contributions will be treated as coming out of the Roth IRA first).  Also, if a distribution is “qualified,” any earnings in the Roth IRA will not be taxed when they are distributed.  A distribution is “qualified” if it is made after the owner is age 59 1/2 (or after the owner’s death or disability, or for a qualified first-time home purchase up to $10,000) and after the owner has had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years. In applying the 5-year rule, count from January 1 of the year the owner’s first contribution was made to a Roth IRA. If a distribution isn’t qualified and the owner is under age 59 1/2, a 10% additional income tax on any earnings will also apply unless an exception is available, such as exceptions for payments made at least annually in equal or close to equal amounts over the owner’s life or life expectancy, payments for qualified higher education expenses, payments up to $10,000 used in a qualified first-time home purchase, and payments for health insurance premiums after the owner has received unemployment compensation for 12 consecutive weeks.</li>  

    <li><strong>Eligibility limits based on income and filing status.</strong> Eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA for a year may be limited depending on the owner’s (and spouse’s, if applicable) modified adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year, and the owner’s tax-filing status. For 2014, eligibility to contribute for individuals with a filing status of single, head of household, or married filing separately (if did not live with spouse at any time during the year) begins to phase out (that is, the annual contribution limit begins to be reduced) at a modified AGI of $114,000, and completely phases out at $129,000. Similarly, eligibility for individuals with a filing status of married or qualifying widow(er) begins to phase out at a modified AGI of $181,000, and completely phases out at $191,000. Finally, eligibility for individuals with a filing status of married filing separately (if lived with spouse at any time during the year) begins to phase out at a modified AGI of $0, and completely phases out at $10,000. These modified AGI thresholds may be adjusted in later years to reflect cost-of-living increases.</li>  

    <li><strong>Annual contribution limits.</strong> There is also an annual limit on how much can be contributed to a Roth IRA (taking into account contributions to other Roth and traditional IRAs). For 2014, the limit is the lesser of $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older by the end of the year), or taxable compensation. Employer contributions under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan do not affect this limit. These annual dollar limits may be adjusted in later years to reflect cost-of-living increases.</li>

    <li><strong>Avoiding excise tax on excess contributions.</strong> Generally, a 6% excise tax applies to any excess contribution to a Roth IRA. However, any contribution that is withdrawn on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing a tax return for the year is treated as an amount not contributed. This treatment only applies if any earnings on the contribution are also withdrawn. The earnings are considered earned and received in the year the excess contribution was made.</li>

    <li><strong>No requirement to take distributions during owner’s lifetime.</strong> A Roth IRA owner is not required to take distributions from a Roth IRA at any age. Thus, the minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs when an owner reaches age 70½ do not apply to Roth IRAs.</li>

  </ul>

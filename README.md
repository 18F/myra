U.S. Department of the Treasury myRA Program
=======================================================

##What

Individual and employer landing pages for the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s new retirement savings program, myRA (“My Retirement Account”).


##Why

This effort is in support of Treasury's new myRA program, which is currently being developed to provide a simple, safe, and affordable way for individuals to start saving.


##How it works

The myRA landing pages are static HTML/CSS/JS pages. We maintain the pages in simple Markdown files, which are compiled into HTML by Jekyll. We also use Sass as a preprocessor for the CSS.  


##Getting started

Ruby gems:

* `gem install jekyll`

Sass libraries:

* `gem install sass`
* `gem install bourbon`
* `gem install neat`
* `gem install bitters`

If you are not familiar with how to work with either Bourbon, Neat, or Bitters, visit their website at [bourbon.io](http://bourbon.io/).

To keep our code updating continuously as we edit, we use `jekyll serve --baseurl '' --watch`.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Some employers have already signed up—that is, they have agreed to help their employees save to myRA accounts by setting up automatic payroll direct deposit. You can participate whether or not your employer is making myRA available, and in either case the steps are the same.</p>
    <p>To find out if your employer is a myRA partner, ask whoever handles payroll.</p>
    <p>Interested individuals will be able to sign up for myRA starting December 15, 2014. Once enrollment is open, here is how it will work.</p>

          <h3>1. Create an account and enroll in online banking</h3>
          <p>Whether or not your employer participates in myRA, your first step is to create an account. Creating an account is easy—it takes just 5-10 minutes.</p>
          <p>Once you have created your myRA account, you can enroll in online banking. Enrolling in online banking allows you to monitor your myRA balance.</p>

          <h3>2. Set up regular savings</h3>
          <p>With your account set up, it’s time to start saving money.</p>
          <p>If your employer is making myRA available, just ask them to set aside a portion of your paycheck into your myRA. And if you have multiple jobs, you can have them all contribute to the same account. Instructions for setting up employer paycheck contributions »</p>

          <p>If your employer is not making myRA available, or if you’re self-employed, you can simply tell your bank to deposit a set amount of money on a regular ongoing basis from your account into your myRA. Instructions for setting up bank account deposits »</p>

          <h3>3. Sit back, relax, and stay in control</h3>
          <p>Because your myRA is receiving automatic contributions, all you have to do is watch your money grow. myRA accounts earn the same variable rate as the low-risk investment option offered to federal government employees.</p>
          <p>You will be able to login to your myRA account to check your balance and manage account settings just like you can at your bank.  It’s your money and you’re in control. You can change your contribution as often as your employer will allow, and you can even withdraw your principal (the money you put in, not the interest you earn) whenever you want.</p>

          <h3>4. Take the next step</h3>
          <p>You can keep saving money in your myRA for 30 years or until you’ve saved $15,000. Once that happens, you will move the money into a private Roth IRA and will decide how to invest it.</p>

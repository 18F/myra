      <p><span class="myra">myRA</span> has been designed for you. Each pay period, you’ll be able to automatically deposit money from your paycheck into a <span class="myra">myRA</span> account. This money will grow risk-free, earning interest. You can save up to $15,000 this way.</p>
      <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>

          <h3 class="numbered-heading"><span class="numbered-heading-number">1.</span><span class="numbered-heading-title">Sign up for <span class="myra">myRA</span></span></h3>
          <p>First, you will open your <span class="myra">myRA</span> account by providing your information online or by phone &mdash; it will take about 10 minutes.</p>
          <p><a href="#" class="modal-trigger" data-modal="signup-modal">Click here to get started <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

          <h3 class="numbered-heading"><span class="numbered-heading-number">2.</span><span class="numbered-heading-title">Set up regular contributions from your paycheck</span></h3>
          <p>Give a direct deposit authorization form to your employer. You'll have the option to print one when you open your account, or use the one you receive in the mail with your welcome package. If you want to contribute from multiple jobs, give each employer a form. Some employers may ask you to use their own direct deposit authorization forms.</p>
          <p>If your employer has questions about setting up direct deposit to your <span class="myra">myRA</span>, you can share a letter we have prepared that explains the process.</p>

          <p>Because of your automatic contributions, all you have to do is watch your savings grow. <span class="myra">myRA</span> earns interest at the same rate as investments in the government securities fund available to federal employees. You’ll be able to check your balance and manage your account online 24/7. </p>

          <p>You can keep saving money in your <span class="myra">myRA</span> for 30 years or until you’ve saved $15,000, and when either of those limits is reached, your savings will be rolled over to a private-sector <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roth-ira/">Roth IRA<sup>*</sup></a> where you can keep saving. You can also choose to roll over your <span class="myra">myRA</span> to the private sector at any time.</p>

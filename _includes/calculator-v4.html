        <p><span class="myra">myRA</span> is a new way to kick start your savings by helping you set aside a few dollars per month. The more you can save the better. And the sooner you start saving, the more time there will be for your savings to grow, giving you more money in retirement.</p>
        <p>For example, say you can save $100 a month. It’s no surprise that if you give yourself just 20 years to save instead of 30, you'll have less savings. And, as the chart shows, you'd also earn less than half the interest compared to starting saving sooner &mdash; that’s $10,486 you'd miss out on.</p>

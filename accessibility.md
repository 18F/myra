#Accessibility

Treasury is committed to making its website accessible to everyone. To meet this commitment, we are striving to make the site compliant with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 1998.

Our website is designed to be equally accessible to those using current, standards-compliant web browsers or assistive technologies.

Achieving compliance with Section 508 is an ongoing process. If you have difficulty accessing any of our web pages or have questions about accessing information on a particular page, please email us at <a href="mailto:myra@treasury.gov">myra@treasury.gov</a>.

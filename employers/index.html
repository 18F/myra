    <h2>About myRA</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Who it's for</h3>
      <p>myRA is not a replacement for traditional retirement plans. Instead, it's for employees who are U.S. Citizens and who do not have access to employer-sponsored plans. American companies and nonprofits of any size can help their employees signup.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>No hassle for employers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No paperwork for employers: There's not forms you need to fill out or program to enroll in. All you do is set up direct deposit for your employees' paycheck.</li>
        <li>No employer contribution: myRA is funded entirely by employees' contributions.</li>
        <li>myRA is not an ERISA plan: </li>
      </ul>

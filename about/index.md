# About <span class="myra">myRA</span>

The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspxU.S" target="blank">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> is offering <span class="myra">myRA</span> (“my Retirement Account”), a new type of Roth IRA<sup><a href="#footnote-1">*</a></sup> – an individual retirement account that provides tax-free income in retirement to people who meet certain conditions. <span class="myra">myRA</span> is a simple, safe and affordable way to save for retirement. Savers can open a <span class="myra">myRA</span> account with no start-up cost and contribute every payday. <span class="myra">myRA</span> will never lose value and there will be no fees to maintain your account. The investment is backed by Treasury. Initially, <span class="myra">myRA</span> will be made available via direct deposit through participating employers.

## Why <span class="myra">myRA</span> was developed
There are millions of working Americans who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet a minimum for opening an investment account.

<span class="myra">myRA</span> was developed to remove those barriers and provide a simple, safe and affordable path for people who want to get started saving with each paycheck. <span class="myra">myRA</span> is not intended to be a replacement for a 401(k) or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts.

## Who is <span class="myra">myRA</span> for?
<span class="myra">myRA</span> will be available to anyone who has an annual income of less than $129,000 a year for individuals and $191,000 for married couples. Annual contribution limits will also apply.

## How <span class="myra">myRA</span> works
The <span class="myra">myRA</span> investment will earn interest at the same variable rate as the government securities fund for federal employees. This fund has had a 2.32% return over the past five years. Individuals may voluntarily roll over <span class="myra">myRA</span> to private-sector individual retirement accounts at any time.

You may deposit a maximum of $5,500 per year (or $6,500 per year if you will be 50 years of age or older at the end of the year), and once the account reaches a balance of $15,000, or after 30 years, the account must be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account.

When account holders change jobs, their <span class="myra">myRA</span> account stays with them, and they can set up payroll direct deposit through their new employer. A saver with multiple jobs can use direct deposit from each paycheck to contribute to a single <span class="myra">myRA</span>.

## How will employees participate?
<span class="myra">myRA</span> will be free and easy for employers to make available to employees. Employers may distribute <span class="myra">myRA</span> information but will not administer employee accounts, contribute to them, or match employee contributions. On payday, employers will send a direct deposit to participating employees’ <span class="myra">myRA</span>.

<section class="footnotes">
  <p id="footnote-1">*A Roth IRA is an individual retirement arrangement that allows you to withdraw the money you contribute to it at any time without paying penalties or taxes. However, you cannot withdraw without penalty any money your contributions earn in the account unless you are 59 ½ or older and the account has been open for at least five years. There are limits to how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA in a single year, and those limits vary by year. A Roth IRA can be a good way to start saving for retirement while allowing you the flexibility to access your contributions to it if you need to.</p>

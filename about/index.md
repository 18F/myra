# About myRA

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering myRA (“My Retirement Account”), a new retirement savings account that offers a simple, risk-free, and affordable way to start saving.
Savers can open a myRA account with no start-up cost and contribute every payday. Your myRA savings will never lose value and there will be no fees. The investments held in the account are backed by the U.S. Treasury.
Initially, myRA will be made available via direct deposit through your employer. It’s an easy process that will not require any contribution from employers.

## The reasons myRA was developed
There are millions of working Americans who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet the minimum for opening an investment account.

myRA was developed to remove those barriers and provide a simple, safe path for people who want to get started saving with each paycheck. myRA is not intended to be a replacement for a 401(k) or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts.

## How myRA works

The myRA investment earns interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan – the same retirement savings plan offered to all federal employees. It’s a Roth IRA, so retirement earnings are tax-free.

We will begin myRA  enrollment  in late 2014 with investments beginning in January 2015.

## How myRA works
The myRA investment will earn interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Individuals may voluntarily roll over myRA to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once myRA reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be transferred to a private-sector retirement account. Treasury will finalize transfer procedures when it launches the myRA program later this year.

You can transfer myRA savings to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once a myRA reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account to continue building savings for your future.

When account holders change jobs, their myRA account moves with them, and they can set up payroll direct deposit through their new employer. A saver with multiple jobs can use direct deposit from each paycheck to contribute to a single myRA.

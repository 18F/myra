# About <span class="myra">myRA</span></span>

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering <span class="myra">myRA</span> (“My Retirement Account”), a new retirement savings account that offers a simple, risk-free, and affordable way to start saving.
Savers can open a <span class="myra">myRA</span> account with no start-up cost and contribute every payday. Your <span class="myra">myRA</span> savings will never lose value and there will be no fees. The investments held in the account are backed by the U.S. Treasury.
Initially, <span class="myra">myRA</span> will be made available via direct deposit through your employer. It’s an easy process that will not require any contribution from employers.

## The reasons <span class="myra">myRA</span> was developed
There are millions of working Americans who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet the minimum for opening an investment account.

<span class="myra">myRA</span> was developed to remove those barriers and provide a simple, safe path for people who want to get started saving with each paycheck. <span class="myra">myRA</span> is not intended to be a replacement for a 401(k) or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts.

## How <span class="myra">myRA</span> works

The <span class="myra">myRA</span> investment earns interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan – the same retirement savings plan offered to all federal employees. It’s a Roth IRA, so retirement earnings are tax-free.

We will begin <span class="myra">myRA</span>  enrollment  in late 2014 with investments beginning in January 2015.

## How <span class="myra">myRA</span> works
The <span class="myra">myRA</span> investment will earn interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Individuals may voluntarily roll over <span class="myra">myRA</span> to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once <span class="myra">myRA</span> reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be transferred to a private-sector retirement account. Treasury will finalize transfer procedures when it launches the <span class="myra">myRA</span> program later this year.

You can transfer <span class="myra">myRA</span> savings to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once a <span class="myra">myRA</span> reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account to continue building savings for your future.

When account holders change jobs, their <span class="myra">myRA</span> account moves with them, and they can set up payroll direct deposit through their new employer. A saver with multiple jobs can use direct deposit from each paycheck to contribute to a single <span class="myra">myRA</span>.

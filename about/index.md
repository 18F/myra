# About myRA

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering the myRA (“My Retirement Account”) program, a new retirement savings account for individuals looking for a simple, safe, and affordable way to start saving. Individuals will be able to open accounts with no start-up cost and contribute to them every payday. myRA balances will never go down and there will be no fees. Initially, myRA will be made available through employers and the investment held in the account will be backed by the U.S. Treasury.

## Who is myRA for?
myRA is designed to help the millions of working Americans who either don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack sufficient retirement savings options. myRA will be Roth IRA accounts available to anyone who has an annual income of less than $129,000 a year for individuals and $191,000 for couples. These limits are subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments. Each individual, not the employer, will be responsible for complying with these income limits. myRA is designed for individuals who want an investment with a low opening amount.

## Signing up for myRA

Initially, participating employers will make myRA information available to their employees. Once the accounts are available, individuals will be able to enroll in the program with no start-up cost. Individuals can then elect to have a portion of each paycheck ($50, $25, $7—any amount!) directly deposited into their myRAs automatically.

We will begin myRA  enrollment  in late 2014 with investments beginning in January 2015.

## How myRA works
The myRA investment will earn interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Individuals may voluntarily roll over myRA to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once myRA reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be transferred to a private-sector retirement account. Treasury will finalize transfer procedures when it launches the myRA program later this year.

An individual who changes jobs can continue to add savings to an existing myRA account by setting up deposits through any employer that offers payroll direct deposit. A saver with multiple jobs will be able to use direct deposit from each paycheck to contribute to a single myRA.

<h1>About <span class="myra">myRA</span></h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov" target="blank">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> is offering <span class="myra">myRA</span> (<i>my</i> Retirement Account), a new type of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roth-ira/">Roth IRA<sup>*</sup></a> that is a simple, safe and affordable way to save for retirement. Individuals can open a <span class="myra">myRA</span>  account with no start-up cost and contribute every payday. <span class="myra">myRA</span>  will not lose value and there are no fees to maintain the account. The investment is backed by the United States Treasury. Initially, <span class="myra">myRA</span>  will be made available via direct deposit through participating employers.</p>


<h2>Why was <span class="myra">myRA</span> developed?</h2>
<p>There are millions of working Americans who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet a minimum for opening an investment account.</p>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span>  was developed to remove those barriers and provide a simple, safe and affordable path for people who want to start saving with each paycheck. <span class="myra">myRA</span>  is not a replacement for a 401(k) or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts.</p>

<h2>Who is <span class="myra">myRA</span> for?</h2>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span>  is for wage earners who have not started to save for retirement and are looking for a simple, safe and affordable way to do so. It’s a good option for anyone who wants to save for retirement but has no access to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan.</p>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span>  is for individuals with an annual income of less than $129,000 per year, or for married couples filing jointly with an income less than $191,000 per year.</p>

<h2>How does <span class="myra">myRA</span> work?</h2>
<p>The <span class="myra">myRA</span>  investment will never lose value – it earns interest at the same variable rate as the government securities fund for federal employees. This fund has had an average annual return of 3.39% over the ten-year period from December 2003 to December 2013.</p>
<p>The maximum contribution to <span class="myra">myRA</span>  is $5,500 per year (or $6,500 per year for individuals 50 years of age or older at the end of the year), and the account can have a maximum account balance of $15,000, or a balance below the maximum for up to 30 years. At any time, individuals can choose to roll over (transfer) their <span class="myra">myRA</span>  into a private-sector <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roth-ira/">Roth IRA<sup>*</sup></a> where they can continue to grow their savings. The United States Treasury will be providing <span class="myra">myRA</span>  participants with more information about roll over into the private-sector.</p>
<p>When account holders change jobs, their <span class="myra">myRA</span>  account stays with them, and they can set up payroll direct deposit through their new employer. Individuals with multiple jobs can use direct deposit from each employer to contribute to a single <span class="myra">myRA</span>.</p>

<h2>How do employers participate?</h2>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span>  is free and it’s easy for employers to make it available to employees. Employers may distribute <span class="myra">myRA</span>  information to employees, but they don’t administer employee accounts, contribute to them, or match employee contributions. On payday, employers simply send a direct deposit to participating employees’ <span class="myra">myRA</span>s.</p>

<h2>How do individuals get started?</h2>
<p>Individuals will be able to sign up for <span class="myra">myRA</span>  in three simple steps:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Open a <span class="myra">myRA</span>  account through this website</li>
    <li>2. Submit a direct deposit authorization to their employer</li>
    <li>3. Manage their account online and track their savings</li>
  </ul>

<h1>About <span class="myra">myRA</span></h1>
<p class="lead-text">The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov" target="blank">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> has developed <span class="myra">myRA</span> (<i>my</i> Retirement Account), a retirement savings account with a new type of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roth-ira/">Roth IRA<sup>*</sup></a> investment that makes saving for retirement simple, safe, and affordable. Individuals can open a <span class="myra">myRA</span> account with no start-up cost and there are no fees for the maintenance of the account. <span class="myra">myRA</span> has no minimum contribution requirement, so savers can contribute the amount that best fits their budget.<sup>*</sup> The investment in a  <span class="myra">myRA</span> is backed by the United States Treasury and the account carries no risk of losing money.</p>

<h2>Why was <span class="myra">myRA</span> developed?</h2>
<p>There are millions of workers in America who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet a minimum for opening an investment account. The United States Treasury developed myRA to address some of these common barriers to retirement saving and to provide a retirement savings option that is simple, safe, and affordable for savers. <span class="myra">myRA</span> is not a replacement for 401(k)s or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts.

<h2>Who is <span class="myra">myRA</span> for?</h2>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span> is for anyone who wants a simple, safe, and affordable way to start saving for retirement. It is a good option for people without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans. Because <span class="myra">myRA</span> follows Roth IRA<sup>*</sup> rules, savers (or their spouses, if married filing jointly) must have taxable compensation to be eligible to contribute to a <span class="myra">myRA</span> account and generally must earn an annual income of less than $129,000 for individuals, and $191,000 for married couples filing jointly<sup>*</sup>*</p>

<h2>How does <span class="myra">myRA</span> work?</h2>
<p>Contributions to <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts are invested in a new United States Treasury security, which safely earns interest at the same variable rate as investments in the government securities fund for federal employees. This fund has had an average annual return of 3.39% over the ten-year period from December 2003 to December 2013.</p>
<p>Savers can contribute to their <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts as little as a few dollars a month up to $5,500 per year (or $6,500 per year for individuals who will be 50 years of age or older at the end of the year).<sup>*</sup> The <span class="myra">myRA</span> account can have a maximum balance of $15,000 or a lower balance for up to 30 years, When either of these limits is reached, savings will have to be rolled over (transferred) into a private-sector Roth IRA. A rollover to the private sector allows savers to continue to grow their savings past the maturity of their <span class="myra">myRA</span> starter savings account. Savers can choose to roll over their account balance into a private-sector Roth IRA at any time. More information will be provided to <span class="myra">myRA</span> account holders about rollover to the private sector in the future.  </p>

<h2>How to contribute to <span class="myra">myRA</span>?</h2>
<p>Currently, savers can fund their <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts from their paychecks, as long as their employer offers direct deposit and is able to direct a portion of the paycheck to the <span class="myra">myRA</span> account. Additional methods to contribute to <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts will become available soon.  </p>
<p><span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts belong to the individuals creating the accounts and are not associated with any employer. This way savers can continue to use the same myRA account even if they move to a new job. They just need to set up direct deposit with the new employer. And if savers have more than one job, they can request contributions to be set up through each employer (although total contributions from multiple sources may not exceed the Roth IRA annual contribution limits<sup>*</sup>).</p>

<h2>How to withdraw from <span class="myra">myRA</span>?</h2>
<p>Savers can withdraw money they put into their <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts tax-free and without penalty at any time. They can withdraw interest earned in their account without tax or penalty five years after their first contribution and if they are 59 ½ years old, or meet certain conditions, such as using the funds for the purchase of a first home. Otherwise, interest earnings would be taxable, and, unless certain other conditions are met, may also be subject to a 10 percent additional tax.</p>

<h2>How do employers participate?</h2>
<p>Employers can help employees start saving for retirement by introducing them to <span class="myra">myRA</span> as a new retirement savings option. <span class="myra">myRA</span> costs nothing for employers to participate; they do not administer employee myRA accounts, contribute to them, or match employee contributions. Each payday, employers simply facilitate a payroll deduction from the employee’s paycheck to the designated <span class="myra">myRA</span> account.</p>

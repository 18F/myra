<h1>About <span class="myra">myRA</span></h1>
<p class="lead-text">To increase retirement savings for more Americans, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has developed <span class="myra">myRA</span> (my Retirement Account), a Roth IRA* that makes saving for retirement simple, safe, and affordable. Individuals can open a <span class="myra">myRA</span> with no start-up cost and there are no fees for the maintenance of the account. <span class="myra">myRA</span> has no minimum contribution requirement, so savers can contribute the amount that best fits their budget<sup>*</sup>. The investment in a <span class="myra">myRA</span> is backed by the United States Treasury and earns interest at the same variable rate as investments in the government securities fund for federal employees. <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts carry no risk of losing value.</p>

<h2>Why was <span class="myra">myRA</span> developed?</h2>
<p>There are millions of workers in America who either don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or lack options to save for retirement. In some cases, they don’t have enough money saved to meet a minimum for opening an investment account. The U.S. Treasury developed <span class="myra">myRA</span> to address some of these common barriers to retirement saving and to provide a retirement savings option that is simple, safe, and affordable for savers. Although anyone eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA* can use <span class="myra">myRA</span> to save for retirement, the program is especially designed for individuals without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans; it is not a replacement for 401(k)s or other types of employer-sponsored retirement savings plans.</p>

<h2>How do employees contribute to <span class="myra">myRA</span></h2>
<p>Currently, savers can fund their <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts from their paychecks, as long as you, as the employer, offer direct deposit and are able to direct a portion of the paycheck to the <span class="myra">myRA</span> account. Additional methods to contribute to <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts will be made available in the future, including ways for employees without access to payroll direct deposit to directly contribute to their <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts.</p>

<p><span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts belong to the employees creating the accounts and are not associated with the employer. This way, savers can continue to use the same <span class="myra">myRA</span> account even if they move to a new job. They just need to set up direct deposit with the new employer. And if savers have more than one job, they can request contributions to be set up through each employer (although total contributions from multiple sources may not exceed the Roth IRA annual contribution limits<sup>*</sup>).</p>

<h2>How do employers participate?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Treasury is working with a number of employers who have signed up to help introduce their employees to <span class="myra">myRA</span> as a new retirement savings option. All employers, however, are encouraged to speak to their employe s about <span class="myra">myRA</span>, display promotional materials, and emphasize the importance of regular savings. It costs nothing for you to offer <span class="myra">myRA</span> to your employees; you do not administer employee <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts, contribute to them, or match employee contributions. Each payday, you simply facilitate a payroll deduction from the employee’s paycheck to the designated <span class="myra">myRA</span> account.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Labor has confirmed that you can distribute <span class="myra">myRA</span> information, facilitate employee enrollment, and otherwise encourage employees to make deposits to <span class="myra">myRA</span> accounts without these actions being treated as establishing or maintaining an employee pension benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). In other words, by facilitating <span class="myra">myRA</span> participation, you won’t become subject to fiduciary, reporting, disclosure, and other ERISA requirements that apply to sponsors of ERISA plans<sup>**</sup>.</p>

<h2>Why should employers participate?</h2>
<p>By introducing and educating your employees about <span class="myra">myRA</span> you accomplish the following:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>You expand your employees’ options for retirement saving, especially for those without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, such as part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees, as well as contracted individuals.</li>
    <li>You provide your employees with a retirement savings option that is easy to understand, safe to invest in, and costs nothing to your employees.</li>
    <li>You create a more attractive workplace for all your employees by showing that you are interested and committed to their financial future.</li>
    <li>You help your employees start saving for retirement and contribute to building a nation of savers.</li>
  </ul>

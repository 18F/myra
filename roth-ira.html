<h1>Summary of Key Roth IRA Features</h1>

<p>A Roth IRA is an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Some key Roth IRA features include:</p>
<h2>Basic tax attributes</h2>
<p>Amounts can be withdrawn from a Roth IRA at any time, but special tax rules apply.  Contributions to a Roth IRA are after-tax, so they will not be taxed again when they are distributed (and these non-taxable contributions will be treated as coming out of the Roth IRA before earnings which may be taxable depending on whether the distribution is qualified).</p>

<p>If a distribution is “qualified,” any earnings in the Roth IRA are not taxable when they are distributed.  A distribution is “qualified” if it is made at least 5 years after the owner’s first contribution to the Roth IRA (counting from January 1 of the year of the first contribution), and the distribution is made:
  <ul class="default-ul">
    <li>after the owner is age 59½;</li>
    <li>for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to $10,000 lifetime limit); or</li>
    <li>to a beneficiary after the owner’s death or disability.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>If a distribution is not “qualified”, any earnings in the Roth IRA are taxable.  In addition, if the owner is under age 59½, a 10% additional income tax on any earnings will also apply unless an exception is available.  While additional restrictions and exceptions may apply, example exceptions include payments for:
  <ul class="default-ul">
    <li>qualified higher education expenses;</li>
    <li>health insurance premiums after the owner has received unemployment compensation for 12 consecutive weeks;</li>
    <li>qualified first-time home purchase (up to $10,000 lifetime limit)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Eligibility for saver's tax credit</h2>
<p>Individuals who contribute to a Roth IRA with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) below certain levels for the year are eligible to claim a saver’s tax credit for their contributions.  The AGI eligibility levels for 2015 are:
  <ul class="default-ul">
    <li>$60,000 for married couples filing jointly,</li>
    <li>$45,000 for heads of household, and</li>
    <li>$30,000 for singles and married individuals filing separately</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Eligible individuals can take the tax credit by filing Form 8880 with their tax return.  The chart below shows the amount of the saver’s credit for different kinds of filers:</p>

<h2>Annual contribution limits</h2>
<p>There is an annual dollar limit on how much can be contributed to a Roth IRA (taking into account contributions to other Roth and traditional IRAs).  For 2015, the limit is the lesser of $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older by the end of the year), or an individual’s taxable compensation (including a spouse’s taxable compensation if a joint filer).  Employer contributions under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan do not affect this limit.  These annual dollar limits may be adjusted in later years to reflect cost-of-living increases.</p>

<h2>Contribution limits based on income and filing status</h2>
<p>Eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA for a year may be limited depending on the owner’s (and spouse’s, if applicable) modified AGI for the year, and the owner’s tax-filing status.  For 2015, the eligibility to contribute depending on filing status is as follows:</p>
<ul class="default-ul">
  <li>For single, head of household, or married filing separately (if did not live with spouse at any time during the year), it begins to phase out (that is, the annual contribution limit begins to be reduced) at a modified AGI of $114,000, and completely phases out at $129,000.</li>
  <li>For married or qualifying widow(er), it begins to phase out at a modified AGI of $181,000, and completely phases out at $191,000.</li>
  <li>For married filing separately (if lived with spouse at any time during the year), it begins to phase out at a modified AGI of $0, and completely phases out at $10,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>These modified AGI thresholds may be adjusted in later years to reflect cost-of-living increases.</p>

<h2>Avoiding excise tax on excess contributions</h2>
<p>Generally, a 6% excise tax applies to any excess contribution to a Roth IRA.  However, any contribution that is withdrawn on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing a tax return for the year is treated as an amount not contributed. This treatment only applies if any earnings on the contribution are also withdrawn. The earnings are considered earned and received in the year the excess contribution was made.</p>

<h2>No requirement to take distributions during owner’s lifetime</h2>
<p>A Roth IRA owner is not required to take distributions from a Roth IRA at any age.  Thus, the minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs when an owner reaches age 70½ do not apply to Roth IRAs.</p>
